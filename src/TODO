Consider a more robust file format, e.g., one in which every shape can tell
you what grid it's on, whether it has Heesch info, and if so, its transforms.
That would avoid a lot o duplication of command line parameters.

Modify viz so that it can show individual shapes without needing to compute
any Heesch info.

Start testing the use of SAT to check for isohedral tiling.
