Consider a more robust file format, e.g., one in which every shape can tell
you what grid it's on, whether it has Heesch info, and if so, its transforms.
That would avoid a lot o duplication of command line parameters.

Modify viz so that it can show individual shapes without needing to compute
any Heesch info.  Ideally in a grid on each page of a PS.

Start testing the use of SAT to check for isohedral tiling.

Better generation of fixed compound polyforms, to make free filtering easier.

Incorporate standard compounds for polyabolos, polydrafters, polyhalfcairos,
etc.
